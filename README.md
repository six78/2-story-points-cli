# Lock, Stock and Two Story Points

♦️️ Decentralized \
♠️ Poker Planning \
♥️ Console Application

// TBD: demo

[//]: # (Fancy a web version? -> https://six78.github.io/lock-stock-2-story-points )

# Description

- We use [Waku](https://waku.org) for players communication.
- Messages are end-to-end encrypted, the key is shared elsewhere as part of the room id

# Get it

# Build it your own
 ```shell
 git clone https://github.io/six78/lock-stock-2-story-points
 cd lock-stock-2-story-points
 go build
 ./ls2sp
 ```
 
Or just run the code with a shadow build:

```shell
go run main.go
```

Now share your room id with friends and start estimating your issues!
