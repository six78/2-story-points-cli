# Components

## Header info

```shell
  Log:	  file:////~/Library/Application%20Support/six78/2sp/logs/waku-pp-2024-03-28T09:01:16Z.log
  Room:   238mvM91TbC9UJdUqKwtWFb
  
  Issue:  https://github.com/six78/2-story-points-cli/issues/42
  Title:  Implement room encryption
```

### Log file path

Log filepath is only shown in `--debug` mode. \
What else you want to know?

### Room

Room shows the RoomID

### Issue

Note that an empty string is kept even when `Title` field is empty. This is to prevent UI from jumping.

2.1. When `Issue.TitleOrURL` is empty:
```shell
   Issue:  <spinner> Waiting for dealer
   
```

2.1. When `Issue.TitleOrURL` is not a URL or provider is not supported:
```shell
   Issue:  <Issue.TitleOrURL>
   
```

2.1. When `Issue.TitleOrURL` is a URL
```shell
   Issue:  <Issue.TitleOrURL>
   Title:  <spinner> Fetching  
```
```shell
   Issue:  <Issue.TitleOrURL>
   Title:  <Fetched issue title>
```

## Players

```shell
  ╭───────┬─────┬─────────┬────────┬─────────╮
  │ Alice │ Bob │ Charlie │ Didukh │ Sirotin │
  ├───────┼─────┼─────────┼────────┼─────────┤
  │   X   │  ✓  │    8    │   13   │<spinner>│
  ╰───────┴─────┴─────────┴────────┴─────────╯
```

### Players

Players are rendered as a table. Vote can be one of these:
- `<spinner>`: voting in progress, player not voted yet
- `✓`: voting in progress, player voted,
- `X`: votes revealed, player didn't vote
- `<value>`: votes revealed, player voted with <value>

### Result 

Next to players table there's a single-column result table.
When voting is in progress, result table should be half-transparent. This is not to disturb the player.

The result value follows these rules:
- `<empty>`: voting in progress
- `<spinner>`: votes revealed, result not published yet
- `<value>`: votes revealed, result is <value>

## Deck

Deck is rendered as a series of single-cell tables. Each cell is a card from a deck.\
Switching between cards is done with `←` and `→` keys.

There are 2 modifiers of card UI - selected and vote.\
Therefore the card can be in one of these 4 states:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Modifiers</th>
<td> - </td>
<td>Selected</td>
<td>Vote</td>
<td>Vote & Selected</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Description</th>
<td>No active modifiers</td>
<td>Card selected with cursor</td>
<td>Card published as vote</td>
<td>Card published as vote and selected with cursor</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>View</th>
<td>

```shell

╭───╮
│ 4 │
╰───╯

```
</td>
<td>

```shell

╭───╮
│ 4 │
╰───╯
  ^
```
</td>
<td>

```shell
╭───╮
│ 4 │
╰───╯


```
</td>
<td>

```shell
╭───╮
│ 4 │
╰───╯

  ^
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

For example for a Fibbonacci deck  

```shell
  Your vote:
              ╭───╮
  ╭───╮ ╭───╮ │ 3 │ ╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭────╮ ╭────╮ ╭────╮
  │ 1 │ │ 2 │ ╰───╯ │ 5 │ │ 8 │ │ 13 │ │ 21 │ │ 34 │
  ╰───╯ ╰───╯       ╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰────╯ ╰────╯ ╰────╯
                      ^ 
```
